# Course Creation Template
Base course creation template that is meant to be forked to create actual course instances

The idea is that you will clone this template for each course you are working on and give it an appropriate name for the directory. For example, you could clone this repository and name it My-Amazing-Udemy-Course. Then, you would have a new directory on your computer with the name My-Amazing-Udemy-Course which would contain all the files, directories and subdirectories in this template.

For those not using version control: Don't get hung up on whether you are forking this or simply downloading and extracting a zip file.

For those who don't know:
The .md extention stands for "markdown". Don't worry it's still just a simple text file.
